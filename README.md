# local-sys1

This repo runs Jev-style System One decision models (typed questions in, calibrated answers out) locally on an Apple Silicon Mac. It sets up two engines and benchmarks them on the same questions:

- **CLM** ([Contrastive-LM/CLM](https://github.com/Contrastive-LM/CLM)): a Qwen3-8B encoder served by [vllm-metal](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal), plus CLM's 75 MB head.
- **Ollaya** ([ollaya-dev/ollaya](https://github.com/ollaya-dev/ollaya)): the `laya` model, run on MLX.

Both speak TypeSafe's `POST /v1/systemone` wire format.

## Install

```bash
brew tap vllm-project/vllm-metal https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal   # the tap needs the URL
brew install vllm-project/vllm-metal/vllm-metal
OLLAYA_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local OLLAYA_NO_SERVICE=1 sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ollaya.dev/install.sh)"
uv sync
```

`contrastive-lm` declares `vllm` as a dependency, but it only calls the embeddings endpoint over HTTP. `pyproject.toml` overrides that dependency away so a second vLLM is not installed.

## Ports

Every server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

| Port | Process | Start |
|---|---|---|
| 8091 | small embedding model (smoke only) | `scripts/serve-embed.sh mlx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-8bit 8091 embed-small` |
| 8090 | Qwen3-8B encoder for CLM | `scripts/serve-embed.sh Qwen/Qwen3-8B 8090 qwen3-8b` |
| 8700 | CLM System One API | `scripts/serve-clm.sh` |
| 11435 | Ollaya daemon | `OLLAYA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435 ~/.local/bin/ollaya serve` |

The serve scripts refuse to start when their port is already taken.

## Check and benchmark

```bash
scripts/smoke-embed.sh 8091                   # vector returned, L2-normalised
scripts/smoke-embed.sh 8090 4096              # Qwen3-8B: 4096 dims, normalised
uv run python bench/run.py --smoke --engine clm      # CLM README example within tolerance
uv run python bench/run.py --smoke --engine ollaya   # same example, shape only
uv run python bench/run.py --out bench/report.md     # 30 questions x 3 reps on both engines, with kernel memory pressure
uv run pytest -q                              # offline tests, fake servers, no model loaded
```

The benchmark rejects any item whose state plus question instructions (the text CLM actually embeds) exceeds 2048 Qwen3 tokens, because `clm-serve` would otherwise truncate it without an error. Treat the accuracy over 30 hand-written items as a sanity check, not a benchmark.
